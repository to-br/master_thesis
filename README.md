# Guide to Master Thesis Simulations

This repository contains the simulation notebooks and scripts used in my master's thesis on TI stimulation and stochastic resonance in LIF neurons.

## Content

- Main results (Membrane potential, PSD of spiketrain and PSD of Vm):
   single neuron simulations: 'psd_single_neuron.ipynb'
   population simulations: 'psd_network.ipynb'
- Simulation scripts: 'build_simulation.py' and 'build_network.py'
- Helper functions: 'utilities.py'

## Notes

The code and file structure are still being cleaned up after submission to improve clarity and reusability.  
Older versions and duplicates have been (or will be) removed.
